1.  Introduction

   The readers are assumed to be familiar with
   [I-D.ietf-tls-ecdhe-mlkem] and [RFC9847].

1.1.  Motivation

   Given the risk of "hardvest-now, decrypt-later" attacks
   [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqc-engineers], we believe that the hybrid key
   agreement mechanisms need to be recommended.

   Section 3 of [RFC9847] defines the meaning of "Y" in "Recommended"
   column as follows:

   |  Y: Indicates that the IETF has consensus that the item is
   |  RECOMMENDED.  This only means that the associated mechanism is fit
   |  for the purpose for which it was defined.  Careful reading of the
   |  documentation for the mechanism is necessary to understand the
   |  applicability of that mechanism.  The IETF could recommend
   |  mechanisms that have limited applicability but will provide
   |  applicability statements that describe any limitations of the
   |  mechanism or necessary constraints on its use.

   This draft aims to build the mentioned consensus.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [I-D.ietf-tls-ecdhe-mlkem] apply.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the following updates to three entries in the
   TLS Supported Groups registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-
   parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-8), according to the
   procedures in Section 6 of [RFC9847].

4.1.  SecP256r1MLKEM768

   Recommended:  Y

4.2.  X25519MLKEM768

   Recommended:  Y

4.3.  SecP384r1MLKEM1024

   Recommended:  Y

               +=======+====================+=============+
               | Value | Description        | Recommended |
               +=======+====================+=============+
               | 4587  | SecP256r1MLKEM768  | Y           |
               +-------+--------------------+-------------+
               | 4588  | X25519MLKEM768     | Y           |
               +-------+--------------------+-------------+
               | 4589  | SecP384r1MLKEM1024 | Y           |
               +-------+--------------------+-------------+
